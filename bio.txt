  My name's Osman. Im a 20 year old software devlopment student who's goal is to earn a computer science degree and work at a reputable software company like microsoft. I've lived in seattle my whole life, and went to local high schools and colleges. I enjoy sports like basketball, swimmming and working out. In my free time, I love watching informational podcasts and documentaries. I excel at troubleshooting computer hardware, but i want to learn all there is to software development. I'm a conscientious indivisual who values hardwork and  organization. If youre like me, youll have a knack for learning something new; so i suggest memorizing some of the tags you'll use in coding.
